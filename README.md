Personal website to showcase my portfolio

## Milestone 2a Feedback
Nice work on these wireframes. The design is clean and simple. I would have liked to see more of of your content strategy in terms of who your target audience could potentially be. By that, I was wondering who it is you see coming to your website and what might they be looking for (i.e. potential collaborators/employers, developers, creatives) Other than that, I am liking the look altogether. 

For an interactive portfolio gallery items, have a look at the following demo for some beautiful text-on-image ideas: https://tympanus.net/Development/HoverEffectIdeas/.

These are a bit more advanced, but a couple of simpler approaches are illustrated here:
- http://css-workshop.com/hover-box-text-over-images-on-hover-and-more/
- http://geekgirllife.com/animate-text-over-images-on-hover-without-javascript

**Be aware that hover doesn't work on mobile**, but for whatever solution you use ensure the effects should still function on click.

You could also consider interactive gallery functionality like [FancyBox3](http://fancyapps.com/fancybox/3/).

Additional resources:
-[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) for custom typography - it has ~1000 fonts and is easy to integrate.
-[FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/) is a good quality free library for including iconography.

Your Milestone 2a passes at [Tier IV](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/). Keep up the momentum!

## Milestone 3
Your PWP looks awesome! I love the hover animations and the site looks good on mobile. It's simple but effective which I appreciate. 

I would consider putting the recaptcha above the submit button on your contact form, and make sure to keep your javascript files together in the js directory in a small project like this. Your CSS is very organized and nice, but I don't know if you need to reference the html tag in it - that should be implied? But overall great job on your PWP.

Your Milestone 3 passes at a Tier IV.
