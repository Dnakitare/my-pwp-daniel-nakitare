Personal website to showcase my portfolio

#### Milestone 1 Feedback
Great job putting together a persona and goals for your website - it really came to life for me and felt very realistic to a bootcamp graduate personal site use case. You were very effective in communicating what you want to create through the persona and I look forward to seeing how you can set up your content strategy and UI design to clearly show off your technical chops in a quick, straight forward way for potential employers.

Your HTML looks great as well - clean and easy to read, with no real technical errors in the set up. Overall I'm very impressed with the code, appearance and ideas behind your Milestone 1 submission. Awesome job!

Your Milestone 1 passes at a [Tier III](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/). You are now clear to begin work on Milestone 2a.
#### Edits & Suggestions
* Your purpose/audience/goal should be more fleshed out and specific to your mission, but your mission was pretty clearly defined in your persona so I don't feel I'm missing any information.
